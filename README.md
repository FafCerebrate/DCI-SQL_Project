# DCI-SQL_Project
For the SQL Project We were tasked with creating 2-3 Business Questions that use the HR Schema from Oracle's Sample Schemas.  
We then create SQL Scripts to answer the questions.



My 2 Business Questions:
1. How many HR employees and departments are in each city?
2. What is the average salary and average years worked per department?
